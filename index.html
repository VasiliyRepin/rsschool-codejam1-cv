              <li><h2>My name is Vasili Repin. I’m 27 years old.</h2></li>
              <li>I am an ambitious person. My main goal is to be the best among the best. I like programming
            so much. Engineerng is my life. I learn new skills and information daily and I spend all my free time for it.
              I am a purposeful person and quickly learn new things. I am an independent person.</li>
              <li>I’m learning web-programming technologies at the moment. And I’ve got some experience in it:
                <ul>
                  <li>PHP junior developer. I’ve been coding for 18 month.</li>
                  <li>Symfony (PHP-framework). Experience: 4 month. I coded my own CMS.</li>
                  <li>MySQL. Confident knowledge.</li>
                  <li>JavaScript. A few experience…</li>
                  <li>HTML, CSS of course. I have basic knowledge.</li>
                  <li>GITHUB. Studying at the moment.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>I know basic principles of OOP and some standards and patterns of development. </li>
              <li>I was coding at PHP 5.5 early after I learned a Robin Nixon’s book “Learning PHP, MySQL & JavaScript, CSS & HTML5”. I saw a lot of videos about programming and performed many examples. I invented some of them myself.

              I used framework Symfony 3.3.9 for my project. It is a site. It’s about a blog & e-commers (the blog with descriptions of goods and overview to all goods which are loaded to the site). I used Doctrine ORM and TWIG in this project. I have a good performance of pattern Model-View-Controller.  I have some experience with CMS OpenCart 2+.

              About MySQL: My skill is sending small and middle-length queries to database both from command line and from PHP-native.
              Unfortunately, my skill in JS is a few. But I coded a square with CSS and through JS my square had a rotation round its axis.

              HTML4, HTML5, CSS3 they are my firstly learned technologies. I have a basic level of understanding these technologies.
              Of course, I have a some skill in Hypertext Transfer Protocol, FTP and charset.

              I work with Windows7 but I worked with Linux Mint earlier. Yes, I can write to command-line a few simple queries.</li>
              <li>Experiece: Nowadays I have a freelance project. It have been finishing over 90%. It's OpenCart CMS theme. I changed header: position of elements and
            paste new icons in CSS and HTML. Some changes are in PHP and JavaScript files and Ajax-requests.</li>
              <li>There are exaples of mine coding
